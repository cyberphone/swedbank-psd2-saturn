# Swedbank PSD2/Saturn Interface

Proof of concept system using Swedbank's Open Banking "sandbox".

![Saturn is great](https://cyberphone.github.io/doc/saturn/saturn-openbanking.png)

Note: some of the code is not entirely "kosher" because the system uses an *unmodified* Open Banking API.

It is (currently) possible testing this system using Android on: https://mobilepki.org/swedbank-psd2-saturn/home

Note: the "Gas station" sample application does not work but that is not due to limitations in this
implementation; it is because the Swedbank Open Banking API does (currently) not support reservation of funds.
